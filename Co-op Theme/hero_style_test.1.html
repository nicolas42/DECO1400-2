<p>This theme lets you customize the layout with short codes.
This shortcode is called <code>hero</code>.
It can include a caption, height, background color and cover image.
If you were doing this on your own site, you’d probably want to compress the
image with <code>mozjpeg</code> and maybe scale it down a bit.
